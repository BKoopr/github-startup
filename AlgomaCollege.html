				Website prototypes for a media and design college that would be located
				in Elliot Lake. It is a town mostly known for having a population of people
				who are retired or are close to retiring and has a declining population.
				The challenge was to create a website prototype that would attract 
				younger people to this town as it may not meet the social needs of
				most students.

				Under the student success section it is important to highlight what life is like
				in Elliot Lake and what services are available for students to use and what sort
				of activities students should look into in the area.
